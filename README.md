#### 🟢 Tasks Completed:
👉 Complete all tasks and claim 250 Points. The API checks and refreshes data every hour, so if you complete a task at 7, check at 8 to confirm. Gravity charges a fee, but if you use Rabby Wallet, you can transfer 1 USDC to your Gas account and pay fees from there.

👉 Increase the fee slightly—if it shows 1800, set it to 3000 to avoid stuck transactions.

👉 You can also do the Mirror Page Mint here: https://mirror.xyz/0x4Da818DD3aAfb9D042a76B5037cdBa61533C7692/jzl9m7iSWPf0c-hsQwbjWLdhk5DiFk6LhfPCXOknu8w
